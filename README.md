- My motivation to complete this project was so that I could have a way to input blog entries and keep them in local storage. 
- I build this project so I could have a more elegant way of tracking blog entries.
- This app solves the problem of not having a way to easily save blog entries online. 
- By completing this challenge, I learned a lot about how local storage works and how powerful it can be as a tool; whether that's storing complex data or just making the user's life easier by saving some inputs.

## Credits

For the buttons used in my project, I took inspiration from the [W3 Schools CSS Button styling guide.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp) While I took their code as inspiration, I changed it up enough that I'm confident it's my own work.
